This project creates a mapping application by using leaflet.js to overlay geoJson data on top ofa OpenStreetMap map of Leon County, Florida.

All that is included in this repository is the main HTML file, which uses a number of javascript libraries, including JQuery and  Leaflet, which are assumed to be installed locally.  It is assumed that anyone cloning these files will serve the files on a local web server--I used apache.

The data files containing the 2010 census block population information and median age information, as well as the zoning data are in GeoJson format.
